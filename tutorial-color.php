                    <p><strong>Primary Colors</strong> - The primary colors are red, yellow and blue, and these three colors are the foundation of all colors. </p>

    <p><strong>Secondary Colors</strong> - When you combine primary colors with other colors you now have secondary colors. For example, when you combine red and blue, you get purple. By combining blue and yellow you get green, and yellow and red make orange.</p>

<p><strong>Tertiary Colors</strong> - Once you combine a primary color (red, blue or yellow) with a secondary color (purple, green or orange) the result is something called a tertiary color. For instance, if you combine the primary color of blue with the secondary color of green, the result is blue-green, also known as aquamarine.</p>
                  <p>Have you ever look at two articles of clothing or two makeup colors and wondered if they would compliment one another if you wore them together?</p>
                      <p>The principle of color theory and color wheel will help you to easily answer that question. Complimentary colors are colors that are located directly across from one another on a color wheel. Here are some examples of complimentary colors: purple and yellow, green and red and blue and orange.</p>
